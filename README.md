PySimpleGUI

PySimpleGUI is a Python package that enables Python programmers of all levels to create GUIs. You specify your GUI window using a "layout" which contains widgets (they're called "Elements" in PySimpleGUI). Your layout is used to create a window using one of the 4 supported frameworks to display and interact with your window. Supported frameworks include tkinter, Qt, WxPython, or Remi. The term "wrapper" is sometimes used for these kinds of packages.

PySimpleGUI was launched in 2018,and has four ports:

Tkinter

PyQt

wxPython

Remi

PySimpleGUI wraps portions of each of these other packages and makes them easier to use. However, each of the ports has to be installed separately.

PySimpleGUI wraps the entirety of Tkinter, which comes with Python. PySimpleGUI has wrapped most of PySide2, but only a small portion of wxPython. When you install PySimpleGUI, you get the Tkinter variant by default. 

One of the biggest advantages of using PySimpleGUI is its simplicity. This module is designed to be easy to use, even for those who are new to Python or GUI programming. The syntax is straightforward and intuitive, making it easy to create basic elements such as buttons and text boxes. Additionally, PySimpleGUI provides a wide range of widgets, so you can create complex, feature-rich applications without needing to understand the intricacies of GUI programming.
